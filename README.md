## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook

### Required Libraries
Install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Dataset Overview 
The dataset includes various features like:
- **Hydrological Data**: Rainfall, water levels, etc.
- **Geographical Indicators**: Elevation, soil type, etc.
- **Temporal Factors**: Time-based data.

Target: Flood probability or severity.

---

## Workflow 
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling
- Train/test split

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Generating derived features
- Calculating aggregates (e.g., feature sums)

### 3. Data Visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.

---

## Models Used 
- **Baseline Model**: Simple Linear Regression
